Problem: Grievances of the public with respect to public places not being efficiently conveyed to government
         
                                         Solution:
             We create an app which acts as an intermediate between government and general public to bring about transparency and efficiency in the functioning of government with respect to public needs. Suppose a user faces problems with respect to public infrastructure; say pothholes on roads, inefficient drainage system, unhygienic public toilets, he simply clicks the picture and uploads it in our platform along with location.The user's identity will be kept anonymous and each user can file only one complaint with respect to a particular place. Based on the population density of the area determined through their location coordinates, a threshold is set for each public place as and when a new complaint is filed.Once, the number of complaints crosses a threshold, the issue is posted publicly on the app implying that the complaint has been sent to the higher authorities. This makes the whole process transparent and the government employees of lower heirarchies could be checked for not undertaking their duties either due to their corrupt attitude or negligence. Our app could in turn make this society a better place coupled with proper functioning of government.
